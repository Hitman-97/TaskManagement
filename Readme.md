This project is a task management application built with React and Zustand for state management. It allows users to manage tasks through features such as filtering, sorting, pagination, and inline editing. The task data is stored using a `Map` structure in Zustand, with the task email as the unique key for efficient lookups. Key features include dynamic search and status filters, sorting tasks alphabetically, and pagination for handling large datasets (50+ records). Users can also reorder tasks using drag-and-drop functionality via `react-beautiful-dnd`. Tasks can be edited inline with a click-to-edit feature, and a modal window enables task addition and editing. The modal supports closing via the Escape key or clicking outside. Performance optimizations are made using React's `useMemo` and `useCallback` to minimize unnecessary re-renders. This application provides a responsive and efficient task management experience.
